		<h1>Tony Stark</h1>
		<p>
			Tony Stark is an American billionaire playboy and ingenious engineer who suffers 
			a nearly-fatal chest injury during a kidnapping in which his captors 
			attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction. Stark's capture leads
			to his creation of the iconic arc-reactor embedded in Stark's chest as well
			(which is used to preserve his health and mitigate the effects of the injury) 
			as well as the development of a powered suit of armor which Stark 
			uses to escape captivity. He later uses the suit and successive versions to 
			protect the world as Iron Man. Through his corporation,Stark Industries, Stark 
			has created many military weapons, some of which, along with 
			other technological devices of his making, have been integrated into his suit, 
			helping him fight crime.
